## About Myself

In 2020, I started to work in an IT company as a copywriter. Now, after 9 months, I decided to learn JS and to become a Front-End Developer. I have strong soft skills and Iâ€™m willing to learn and develop new skills.

## Skills

- HTML
- CSS

- Git

## Code Example

```
const text = 'When \t\n you play a \t\n game of thrones you win or you die.';
console.log(text.substring(4, 15).trim().length);
```
